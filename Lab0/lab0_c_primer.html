	<strong>Practice with C Programming:</strong> This lab serves to reinforce your 
	proficiency in C programming, particularly with pointers, 
	dynamic memory allocation (malloc), and manual memory management (free), 
	which are critical for systems programming and performance-sensitive applications.

Your tasks for this lab are as follows: 

<ol>
	<li>
		<strong>Learn Linked List Implementation:</strong> You practice implementing core operations on linked lists, 
		such as node creation, insertion, traversal, and deletion. 
		This helps build your understanding of memory management 
		(dynamic memory allocation and deallocation), pointers, and 
		struct usage in C.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Solve Real-World Problems:</strong> By solving problems such as detecting cycles in linked lists and merging 
		two sorted lists, you apply your understanding of algorithms and data structures to real-world scenarios. 
		These problems introduce concepts like fast/slow pointer techniques (cycle detection) and algorithmic merging 
		(sorting and combining data structures).	
	</li>
